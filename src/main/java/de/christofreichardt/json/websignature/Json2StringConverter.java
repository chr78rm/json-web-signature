/**
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are required when formatting JSON structures in a predictable way prior to
 * applying digital signatures. Logically identical JSON structures may have different signatures dependent on
 * their formatting. RFC 7515 doesn't specify or reference a JSON canonicalization scheme although there exists
 * one (RFC 8785). This is understandable since e.g. RFC 8785 applies a "bury the head in the sand" strategy when dealing
 * with "Big Numbers", that is RFC 8785 explicitly forbids the serialization of "Big Numbers" by using the JSON number type
 * without even saying what qualifies as "Big Number". Instead those "Big Numbers" must be wrapped using JSON strings without
 * even specifying how this should be exactly done either. Needless to say that the ECMA standard 404 ("The JSON
 * Data Interchange Syntax") doesn't forbid arbitrarily big numbers as JSON numbers.
 * The internet draft "JSON Schema Validation: A Vocabulary for Structural Validation of JSON" explicitly states
 * in section 4.2 "The JSON specification allows numbers with arbitrary precision, and JSON Schema does not add any such bounds."
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Different line endings may lead to different signatures as well.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Jakarta JSON Processing reference implementation (Eclipse Parsson) does print a JSON structure without any line breaks and spaces
 * onto one line when invoking <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/apidocs/jakarta/json/jsonvalue#toString()">toString()</a>
 * but this is unspecified either. This distribution invokes indeed {@code toString()} prior to computing the signature if you don't
 * explicitly specify a converter like the {@link de.christofreichardt.json.websignature.PrettyStringConverter}.
